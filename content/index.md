hi, welcome to Polymathic Magic, a hidden magical lab tucked away in a secret corner of the web. ðŸ§ªâœ¨ðŸ”®
entry isn't open to all yet, so consider yourself one of a chosen few to witness something in it's *super* early stages. 

I'm saumya, and I'm the sorcerer in chief here. 

Sometimes I go on wild, sometimes unhinged explorations and get lost in obsessive research on all kinds of random things. Itâ€™s chaotic, imperfect and a mix of all sorts of things, but thatâ€™s where the magic happens.
